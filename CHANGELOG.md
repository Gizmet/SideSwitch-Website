## Development Notes

### Splash Screen Evolution
The splash screen has evolved through several iterations:
1. **Original**: Video-based splash using `splash.webm`
2. **Debug Phase**: Complex JavaScript canvas animations (unreliable)
3. **Current**: Clean HTML/CSS with JavaScript timing (reliable)

### Architecture Decisions
- **IPC Communication**: Uses context bridge for security
- **Window Management**: Splash-first approach prevents race conditions
- **Animation**: CSS-based for performance and reliability
- **Fallbacks**: Multiple timeout and communication methods

### Future Considerations
- Video splash option for more complex animations
- Configurable splash duration
- Theme-based splash variations
- Performance monitoring for splash timing
