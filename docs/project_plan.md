# Project Plan: Cross-Platform Chat Roulette Dashboard

## Overview
This project aims to create a cross-platform desktop application that integrates multiple chat roulette sites into a consistent UI. The application will be built using Electron, allowing it to run on both Linux (EndeavourOS) and Windows systems. The UI will feature embedded browser tabs for different chat sites, along with control buttons for SKIP, STOP, and BLUR functionalities.

## Key Components

### 1. Framework Selection
- **Electron**: Use Electron to create a cross-platform desktop application. It allows us to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the UI and provides a way to package the app for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

### 2. UI Design
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Design the UI using web technologies.
- **Embedded Browser Tabs**: Use Electron's `webview` tag to embed browser tabs for different chat sites.
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

### 3. Webcam Integration
- **WebRTC**: Use WebRTC for real-time webcam streaming.
- **Permissions**: Handle permissions for accessing the webcam.

### 4. Control Functionality
- **SKIP, STOP, BLUR**: Implement these features using JavaScript.

### 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases
- **Network Issues**: Handle network interruptions gracefully.
- **Permission Denials**: Manage cases where webcam access is denied.

### 6. Performance Optimization
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Optimize CPU and memory usage.

### 7. Build and Deployment
- **Electron Builder**: Use Electron Builder to package the application for Linux and Windows.
- **Configuration**: Set up build configurations for both operating systems.

## Updated UI Design
- **Top Navigation**: Create buttons for each site (e.g., OME, Monkey, Omegle) at the top to switch the embedded browser view.
- **Main Video Area**:
  - **Participant Webcam Feed**: Display on the left.
  - **Host Streamer Feed**: Display on the right.
- **Bottom Controls**: Implement BLUR, STOP, and SKIP buttons at the bottom.

## Updated Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Electron Project**
   - Use Electron to create the application structure.

2. **Design the HTML Layout**
   - Use HTML and CSS to create the layout as per the sketch.
   - Use the `webview` tag to embed browser tabs.

3. **Implement JavaScript Functionality**
   - Handle tab switching and control button actions (BLUR, STOP, SKIP).

4. **Integrate WebRTC**
   - Use WebRTC for handling webcam streams.

5. **Test and Optimize**
   - Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on both Linux and Windows.

## Required Dependencies and Installation
- **Node.js and npm**: Required for setting up the Electron project.
- **Electron**: For building the cross-platform application.
- **Electron Builder**: For packaging the application.

## Installation Commands

For Arch Linux (EndeavourOS):
```bash
sudo pacman -S nodejs npm
npm install -g electron
npm install -g electron-builder
```

For Windows, you can download Node.js and npm from the official website and use the same npm commands to install Electron and Electron Builder.

## Next Steps
- **Research APIs**: Start by researching the APIs or web interfaces of the target sites.
- **UI Prototyping**: Create a basic UI prototype.
- **Webcam Integration**: Implement basic webcam functionality.
